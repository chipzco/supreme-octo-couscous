    ease do not take the post as an endorsement of using jQuery with Angular 2. I do not think it’s a good idea. Most stuff you use jQuery for cam be done directly from Angular 2.

    However, there might be legitimate reasons for using jQuery, like using jQuery widgets and plugins that do not have a non-jQuery based equivalent. If you are facing that, try this guide: 

If you are using the Angular CLI (my personal recommendation), you can use jQuery with Angular 2 in very few and easy steps as follows:

First: Install jQuery, the actual library

	
npm install jquery --save

Then: Install jQuery TypeScript autocomplete

	
npm install @types/jquery --save-dev

Finally: Go to the ./angular-cli.json file at the root of your Angular CLI project folder, and find the scripts: [] property, add this inside it:

	
"../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"

(or use the slim version if that’s your cup of tea, keep the rest of the path as-is)

After that, jQuery will be available for you as a global variable. You can log jQuery’s version (which is available as jQuery.fn.jquery) to ensure it’s working brilliantly.
